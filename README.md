# PrintDemon
This is an [PowerShell Empire](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire) launcher PoC using [PrintDemon](https://github.com/ionescu007/PrintDemon) and [Faxhell](https://github.com/ionescu007/faxhell). The module has the Faxhell DLL already embedded which leverages [CVE-2020-1048](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1048) for privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an unprivileged user to gain system-level privileges and is based on @ionescu007 PoC.

__Note__: This is a proof of concept. We have encountered some issues with printing to C:\Windows\System32\Ualapi.dll on some machines. We have not yet isolated what is causing this. You can drop the dll directly into System32 to test the launcher if you encounter issues.
